âœ… Option 2: Learn New Concepts via a New Mini Project
If you feel confident with what you've done and want a fresh topic to keep it exciting, here are 2 simple project ideas:

ðŸ§© 1. "Todo App" in Vanilla JS
Add, edit, delete tasks

Persist in chrome.storage.local

Show count of pending tasks

Optional: Sync across tabs

ðŸŒ™ 2. "Dark Mode Toggle" Extension
One-click toggle between light/dark mode for any site

Store user preference in storage

Learn how to inject scripts into web pages

ðŸ¤” Recommendation for You:
Based on your recent questions and desire to learn by doing (not copy-paste):

ðŸ‘‰ Stay with this project for 1-2 more features.
That way:

You reinforce your existing understanding

You stretch slightly beyond your comfort zone

Youâ€™re still moving and not stuck in "tutorial purgatory"

ðŸ”§ What to Do Now:
Would you like to pick one of the small enhancements (like edit, sort, or track usage) and Iâ€™ll guide you step by step?

Or do you want a clean break and try a new mini-project?
