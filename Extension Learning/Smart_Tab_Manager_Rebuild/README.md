Great approach, Abhishek. Here's a polished `README.md` for your **Smart Tab Manager** Chrome Extension project:

---

## 🚀 Smart Tab Manager

A minimal yet powerful Chrome Extension that helps you manage your open tabs with ease. Search, switch, pin, close, and even bookmark tabs directly from a clean popup interface.

### ✨ Features

* 🔍 **Live Search**: Filter open tabs by title or URL.
* 📌 **Pin/Unpin Tabs**: Pin or unpin tabs to keep important ones in view.
* ❌ **Close Tabs**: Close tabs directly from the extension.
* ⭐ **Bookmark Tabs**: Save tabs under a special `Smart Tab Bookmarks` folder.
* 🧠 **Prevents Duplicates**: Won’t bookmark a tab more than once.

### 📁 Folder Structure
